# Simple Linear Regression for Predicting Percentage Score

This GitHub repository contains a simple Python implementation of a linear regression algorithm to predict percentage scores based on the number of study hours. This project serves as a basic example of how linear regression can be applied for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains two columns: "Hours" (the number of study hours) and "Scores" (the corresponding percentage scores).
You can access the dataset from here: http://bit.ly/w-data

## Implementation
 #### Import libraries  
 #### Import dataset  
 #### Plotting the distribution of scores

 From the graph above, we can clearly see that there is a positive linear relation between the number of hours studied and percentage of score.  
 #### Preparing the data  
 Divide the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs) or X and Y  
 #### Split the data into training and test sets 
 #### Training the Algorithm  
 #### Making Predictions    
Predict from your own data  

Ex: No of Hours = [[9.25]]  
Predicted Score = 93.69173248737539  
#### Evaluating the model
